Hello there! In 2023, I earned my Master's degree in Data Analytics from the University of Sydney. Prior to this, I studied biological engineering at Shandong University with a dual degree in finance.

This educational journey was shifty but pivotal in unveiling my true strengths and passion, which is centred around working around data, especially identifying patterns, building logical connections between entities and events, and trying to tackle real problems leveraging analytical results. Being exposed to new subjects does not make me feel overwhelmed but only makes me stay motivated with constant learning.

My main interests and major experiences lie in statistical learning and business intelligence, encompassing machine learning-driven data analytics, data dashboarding, and business digitalization. I am leaning towards the technical side, currently taking online classes in data engineering and self-learning web scraping, concerning the upstream aspects of data lifecycle (since I believe that aligning collection and analytics does affect data quality).

Cutting-edge technologies never fail to amaze me. The recent leap in generative AI, especially, captivated my attention in the last couple of months. I summarized and simplified some of the research, turning them into more accessible video scripts with some demonstrations - which was what I did for the part-time job in Preface AI.

Besides, I am an avid fan of hardcore classic roguelike games, I have invested considerable time into Caves of Qud, CDDA, ToME, Dwarf Fortress, etc.. I am even ambitiously thinking about making one myself. I was developing using Unity with C#, making progress in getting familiar with it, but now I'm switching the project to Godot Engine since the pricing controversy happened.

I am looking for a full-time job, either in research or industry, where I can apply my skills and contribute to meaningful projects.
