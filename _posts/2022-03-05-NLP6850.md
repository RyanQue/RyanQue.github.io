## Introduction

*This blog post was initially written in 2022 as a summary of a in-class ML project. [check this link.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/qbus6850-2022s1-assignment/overview) Several articles shed light upon the structure of the neural network I developed in this project, which gave me a basic idea of how to construct a neural network, as well as the modulized design behind the scene.*

This repository contains the files of the project.

In this blog, natural language processing and neural network are the major 2 parts that would be elaborate on, including several techniques, libraries that are usually would not be used when handling ordinary numerical data.
